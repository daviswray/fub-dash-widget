You are building a web application that will be deployed on Heroku and integrated with FollowUpBoss CRM. Here are the key environmental constraints and patterns you must follow:

**HEROKU DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Single dyno architecture: one process serves both frontend and backend on the same port
- Must use process.env.PORT (defaults to 5000) - no other ports are accessible
- Include a Procfile with web process definition
- Build process must generate production-ready static assets
- All environment variables configured through Heroku config vars
- Application must handle both development and production serving modes

**FOLLOWUPBOSS ECOSYSTEM CONTEXT:**
- This is a CRM-focused business environment dealing with real estate transactions
- Applications typically handle agent management, deal tracking, and client interactions
- Form submissions often create events, notes, or updates in external CRM systems
- Data validation is critical for business processes (agent assignments, transaction types, etc.)
- Common data entities: agents, deals, clients, transactions, events, notes
- Integration patterns involve API calls to external services for data synchronization
- User workflows typically involve multi-step forms with conditional logic

**TECHNICAL ENVIRONMENT EXPECTATIONS:**
- TypeScript for type safety in business logic
- Modern React patterns with proper state management
- Database operations require careful validation and error handling
- API responses should follow consistent success/error patterns
- Form handling needs robust validation with clear user feedback
- UI should be professional and accessible for business users
- Development workflow should support both local development and Heroku deployment

**ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS:**
- Shared validation schemas between frontend and backend
- Modular API routing with proper error middleware
- Static file serving in production with development hot-reload
- Environment-aware configuration (dev vs prod)
- Clean separation between client, server, and shared code

Build your application following these patterns and constraints. The end result should be a production-ready application that can be deployed to Heroku and integrate seamlessly with FollowUpBoss workflows.
